This project includes two python codes running in the background.
First is server.py which acts as a middleware software and thus exposes an endpoint at gateway to recieve sensor data from SBC's and save output to the dataset.csv file.
Second is client.py which acts as an edge program running continuously which sends the sensor data to the server every one minute with all other required functionality.
There's a requirements.txt files which includes the name of liraries(which are not included by python in default) that should be installed before running this project.
There will be two log files generated, server.log and client.log respectively to capture the logs of both python codes by same name. These log files will be rotated automatically after reaching a certain size limit set in the python codes.
There will be a file generated by name offlineDB.json which saves the buffered data for when the client is not able to contact the server or doesn't recieve http 200 status code.
The redis_installation.sh file contains the commands to run a local redis based DB.

The project can be run at any linux distribution based systems by running the following command in the directory where all other files are lying:-

sudo sh run.sh
